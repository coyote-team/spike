A full-body photograph of a male MCA Curator. He leans against a window, with his hands in his pocket and his right leg casually crossed over his left. He wears a white dress shirt with a navy blue, fitted dress jacket and pants. He wears thick framed, black glasses and stares expressionless at the camera.
