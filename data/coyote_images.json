The one on the left is oriented vertically and rests on the floor, leaning against the wall. It leaves a reflection on the floor. At the corner of each box is a photograph of the same man. He is old, with pale skin and an angular face, grey hair, and shadowed eyes. In the horizontal box, we see a cropped image of his solemn face at the far left. In the vertical box, he is positioned at the bottom. Wearing white, loose-fitting clothes, he appears to sit cross-legged on the ground.",

"description_text":"This painted portrait depicts a young woman with jet-black skin holding a long, thin paintbrush up to a colorful, messy painter’s palette. She is shown in a three-quarter pose, gazing directly at the viewer. Her face, which is central to the square composition, stands out against a large, white, canvas, almost blending into the pitch-black background to her right. Closer inspection reveals, however, that her skin is subtly rendered, with various shades of contours and highlights. She wears two large hoop earrings, three small hoop earrings, and an oversized, boxy, high-collared jacket made of stiff fabric. Her voluminous hair—black with an ochre sheen—rises in thick coils on top of her head. The canvas to her left shows a partly finished paint-by-number self-portrait; in it, her likeness is broken up into smaller segments with pale-blue outlines and numbers. She has outlined many of the segments and filled them in with colors from her palette: orange, blue, yellow, pink, brown, and a few shades of green. The paint-by-number canvas does not accurately represent the color and pattern of the jacket she wears, which features mustard yellow sleeves and collar and deep blue and maroon and light yellow stripes.",

"description_text":"A beige, square canvas with a slender, dark wood frame. A large, dark orange circle nestled within three concentric rings occupies the bottom center of the painting. The innermost circle is a solid, yellow-orange, resembling the yolk of an egg. It is is uniformly encircled by a thin and white ring. The next ring is the largest; it is bright yellow and broad, almost the width of the center circle’s radius. It is an imperfect ring, with a small, rounded bite missing at the 11 o’clock position. A fourth ring, slightly darker beige than the canvas, appears faint and transparent; the effect is less a shadow than a secretion spreading from the paint. The circles are vivid and immediately draw your eye, but they show no illusion of depth, and the overall effect of the painting is very flat. As you look closer, you notice a tiny dot of bright yellow floating to the upper left of the circles, like a planet orbiting a many-ringed sun. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

"description_text":"This is an installation that takes up a whole gallery and overflows into the next room. From this viewpoint you are looking at a doorway and the room beyond, as if standing inside of a large cave and looking out of its narrow entrance at the world outside. The walls of this cave are alternating stripes of red, white, and blue made of some kind of thin fabric material. The colored stripes spiral around toward the entrance, as if being sucked out of the opening. The inside of the cave is more shadowed and the area outside is brightly lit. Gradually you notice that there are in fact two openings lined up in front of each other, straight ahead of you: the first one is a tall rectangle—the red, white and blue fabric is wrapped through the edges of a standard doorway; beyond that it continues to spiral around toward a circular opening. The center of this circle is much brighter, as if one had finally escape from the cave. At the center of that circular opening you see two white fans, blowing air into the cave-like opening. Beyond the fans you see a brown, square form, which is the bottom of a huge wicker basket. This basket, lying on its side, helps to reveal the truth about what you are seeing: You are standing inside of a huge hot air balloon, which is lying on its side. Blown by the fans, the fabric billows out to press out against the existing walls of a large room, the malleable shape of the balloon conforming to the rectangular surfaces of an existing building–the gallery that contains it.",

The photograph is twice as tall as it is wide, capturing the second and third floors and slivers of the adjacent galleries. The tables are set for dinner and—apart from the floral centerpieces—dressed entirely in white. A diffuse light from the left gallery, however, bathes them in a yellow glow. In the background, a single rectangular panel lines each wall, running parallel to the ground. They are painted in color gradations—changing from yellow to green to blue on the right wall and from yellow to orange to red on the left. The room appears vacant, but closer inspection reveals four men standing at the back of the room, dressed in tuxedos and blending in with dusky exterior. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

She poses like a pop singer with her eyes looking directly at the viewer, her gaze is made more unnerving by the intensely bright yellow white contact lenses she is wearing which cover her irises entirely and reduce her pupils to small black dots.

"description_text":"In this installation view, taken from the viewer's left of the sculpture, we see three square boxes lined up along the wall. The boxes are as tall as they are wide, but with much smaller depth.  Six wooden heads sit on the boxes, two on each box. The \"face\" of the first head from the left is simple a concave half-sphere carved into the wood. The second face is carved and colored to be light skinned with eyees closed. The third head is a roughly spherical ball of wood, with a very long conical nose that extends far out in front of the work, obscuring the remaining three heads. Each of the three remaining heads appear to be variations of the light-skinned face from the second head. The depth of the boxes are just large enough to comfortably accomodate the heads. Each box is painted black on its front face. The narrow face of the box closest to the viewer is mirrored.  The other two narrow box faces are partially obscured given how close the boxes are to one another, but appear to be colorfully painted.  Each box is raised off the ground by four cylindrical legs.  Below each box rests a pair of worn shoes.",

"description_text":"In this painting, a man wearing dress clothes—black pants, loafers, a white button-up and tie—sits on a swivel chair and pensively rests his chin on his hand while crossing his legs. He sits atop a structure that forms part of a multicolor compound resembling a sprawling miniature town. This town is composed of numerous open stairways, arches, courtyards, a smoke stack, and pillars, and it is characterized by multicolored surfaces (in red, orange, green, purple, and blue) and hard edges. Two tall structures bearing the portraits of two men loom over the self-contained environment. The man and the small world he contemplates reside in a dark landscape of green grass and night sky. A many ringed circle of different light blues interrupts the darkness to form a halo backdrop of the seated man's bust. ",

"description_text":"A video still of a light-skinned man with dark facial hair wearing headphones. He is dressed professionally; a light grey collared shirt under a black suit jacket and navy blue tie with white and faint red diagonal stripes. In the breast pocket of his suit there is a bright red handkerchief. His mouth is open mid-sentence and he is standing in front of a ThinkPad laptop holding a microphone on a goose neck mike stand attached to what is presumably a lectern supporting the laptop. The background is split down the middle, a beige stone wall on the right and a blue wall to the left, or perhaps it is a clean blue chalkboard, ready for an idea. The slight pixelation, high contrast, and over-modulated color (especially the red) make it clear that this is a still frame of a video.",

"description_text":"A young bearded man, dressed in a suit and tie, fingers a microphone and leans in to speak. The setting is professional: the man stands at a podium, a laptop open in front of him. The blackboard behind him, along with the cinderblock wall it is mounted on, evoke a meeting room—maybe a classroom. Only a few hints suggest that this may be a special day for the man in the picture. His glossy black hair, peeking out from underneath a pair of high-end headphones, is tousled, rakishly askew. His pocket handkerchief is a natty, cherry red, the kind of color that one wears for an occasion. And his lips turn up at the corners, almost imperceptibly, in a rascally smile. Why does he smile? Perhaps it is a day for celebration. Has he finally turned in his thesis? Have his students aced their image description assignments? Maybe it is his birthday. To the viewer, the cause is mysterious. But we may imagine! Let’s suppose it is his birthday. And out of frame, his favorite student-clients send him their best wishes for a very happy day. Happy birthday, young man! ",

Upon closer inspection, one realizes that the fabric is made of hundreds of thousands of sewing needles held to one another with a barely visible white silk thread. The artwork gives the initial impression of being a simple fabric but as the viewer realizes that the piece is meticulously made of so many sharp and hard pieces, the illusion of soft folds become more impressive. The fabric looks weightless, like a ghost fabric. ",

The center video projection is also rectangular in shape, but since it is projected at the intersection of the room's corner and ceiling. the shape of the video is distorted. The video on the right is flush to the edge of the room and diamond shaped. The cool colors of the video projections contrast with the warm red light cast by three red ceiling lights.",

The room has a divider with two pillars about mid-way through the space.  The left hand side of the room has a projected video showing large hexagonal shapes in bright green, blue, red, teal and yellow.  Ambiguous insect shapes barely recognizable as bees are crawling on top of the hexagons which may be interpreted as honeycombs.  On the right inside the warehouse space, a stack of twelve video monitors on a base of possibly more monitors is showing the image of a bright yellow flower.  Each monitor contains a partial image of the flower producing an overall grid effect.  In the upper left hand corner of the photo a video monitor is visible facing in the direction of the projected image.",

"description_text":"This is an image of a projected video inside a dark space, presumably a gallery but the scale of the room is unclear.  The bottom of the video projection is flush with the ground and the top is about thee times the height of an average person.  The video depicts the facade of a three story building painted white with burnt umber details.  The facade has dark horseshoe shaped arch-style openings that may be windows or doors but do not have glass inside them.  There are two large arch opening on the first floor.  The arch on the left is dark, but the arch on the right is open and inside the opening a second video projection is visible, perhaps six feet beyond the opening.  The second video, visible through the archway, depicts the fact of a monkey over what appears to be the back of seats in a dark movie theater, giving the impression that an audience will soon arrive and watch the monkey from the theater seats.  The only other figure is that of a man's silhouette on the left of the screen, likely a viewer inside the gallery.  More ambiguous, to the right of the open archway, are the silhouetted figures of two people, probably women or teen girls.",

The thin, formally dressed man in the center is jumping into the air with his arms outstretched and his legs crossed. In the left foreground, also wearing a dark suit, is the torso of a man seen from the rear.  This man, along with another, more casually dressed  seated man on the right of the image, are watching the leaping man.  In the foreground we see a small television monitor on which a live image of the leaping man is projected, with the camera angle tilted in a way that makes it look like he is jumping sideways.  Behind the leaping man various framed posters hang on a white wall and ceiling tiles are visible overhead.",

"description_text":"In the photograph you seem to stand in a small clearing sparsely populated with flattened weeds in the fore and middle grounds and with an uneven arc of wild grass two-thirds up the image. An impenetrably dark row of trees fills the horizon. The photograph is black and white and strongly lit, so that each blade of grass and clump of dirt casts an intense shadow. At your feet lies a short, crudely dug trench, whose excavated soil remains, forming a rim around it. The shallow slit, dug from bone-dry earth, lies in the middle of the image and tapers at the end nearest you. From the trench’s pitch-black interior, a blast of opaque, white smoke streams out, billowing directly up and off the photograph’s top edge.",

"description_text":"This painted portrait depicts a young woman with jet-black skin holding a long, thin paintbrush up to a colorful, messy painter’s palette. She is shown in a three-quarter pose, gazing directly at the viewer. Her face, which is central to the square composition, stands out against a large, white, canvas, almost blending into the pitch-black background to her right. Closer inspection reveals, however, that her skin is subtly rendered, with various shades of contours and highlights. She wears two large hoop earrings, three small hoop earrings, and an oversized, boxy, high-collared jacket made of stiff fabric. Her voluminous hair—black with an ochre sheen—rises in thick coils on top of her head. The canvas to her left shows a partly finished paint-by-number self-portrait; in it, her likeness is broken up into smaller segments with pale-blue outlines and numbers. She has outlined many of the segments and filled them in with colors from her palette: orange, blue, yellow, pink, brown, and a few shades of green. The paint-by-number canvas does not accurately represent the color and pattern of the jacket she wears, which features mustard yellow sleeves and collar and deep blue and maroon and light yellow stripes.

The scale of the figures is about double the size of an average person and the are arranged about a half of a figure length apart from each other.  The figure on the left appears to have it's head tilted to the sky, while the center figure faces to the right, where the third figure bends lightly towards the ground, hand upraised.  The bright color of the figures contrasts with urban scene in the background: behind the figures a black fence, green leafy trees and tall gray buildings are visible.  The sky is bright blue and the bright light of mid-day casts sharp shadows below the figures.",

The one on the left is oriented vertically and rests on the floor, leaning against the wall. It leaves a reflection on the floor. At the corner of each box is a photograph of the same man. He is old, with pale skin and an angular face, grey hair, and shadowed eyes. In the horizontal box, we see a cropped image of his solemn face at the far left. In the vertical box, he is positioned at the bottom. Wearing white, loose-fitting clothes, he appears to sit cross-legged on the ground.",

Behind the grid and projecting diagonally from the sides are metal rods that connect to a horizontal bar with circles or wheels. It looks much like a tool or piece of machinery, perhaps a cart used to move heavy boxes. Hanging randomly amongst the metal bars are soft white and yellow, organic shaped objects, much like banana peels. While the sculpture gives the appearance of being tall due to its verticality, the scale is not apparent.",

The center of the square is stained with gray and beige greasy smudges that form a radial pattern from the center. The empty spaces in the radial pattern form wedges that when put together create a circle. This effect makes it clear that this is one half of an empty pizza box. Above and slightly off-center from where the original pizza would have been is another small circle, traced out with a thin gray line. Two small red dots are contained within the circle, off-center and on opposite sides.",

The top 3/4 of the image is made up of three equal-sized vertical rectangles of red, blue and mint green.  Below the large squares is a line of six long thin horizontal rectangles in blue, black, mint green, red, and black.  The bottom layer is slightly larger thin horizontal rectangles of mint green, white, grey and black.

The smaller black rectangle set off to the right, overlaps the larger one. Painted in its center is a flat, white cuboid shape. A blue line runs horizontally across the center of all of rectangles, continuing along the wall past the edges of the frames. The blue line is perfectly straight, aside from where it intersects the painting of white cuboid: there it follows the sides of the cuboid, giving the illusion of three dimensionality.",

The woman is wearing tan-colored clothing and shoes that match her skin tone and short-bleached hair and blend into the faded brick of the building behind her.  Wires emerging from the woman's ears imply she is wearing head phones. The gesture of her arms, along with her closed eyes and upturned head, suggest that she is listening to music.",

Hanging from the ceiling at the top of the image, we see an artwork or perhaps a set design piece made from interlocked spheres.  These spheres, with about a 5 inch diameter, are shades of light blue and sea foam green and clustered together in an amorphous shape.  This hanging form is casting a shadow on a large rectangular screen.  The screen, which may also be interpreted as large video still, shows a dancing couple.  The couple are wearing bodysuits similar in color to the hanging spheres.  The couple's hands are entwined mid-movement, with the female figure on the right throwing her arm back and flinging her straight leg up with a pointed toe.  The male figure lunges forward in profile.",

Next to him, a white, late-middle aged man in a formal suit and tie, is clapping and smiling.  The clapping man will be identifiable to Illinois residents as Pat Quinn, former governor of Illinois.  The men are embracing inside an interior lit with daylight, with white curtains pulled back as decorative accents.
